# What is it? 

The bookstore is a business model with a main focus of selling books to diverse types of
customers. It is an old trade that has crossed generations and increased over the years,
establishing itself as a timeless business.

To develop an accurate strategy, the bookstore depends on a database that contains the data
entities pertaining to the business such as; books, publisher, author, customer, employees and
orders. Once the database has all this information, it is possible to access and manipulate all
data about the transactions that were carried out, which include purchasing, selling and
updating the information about the stock and customers.
